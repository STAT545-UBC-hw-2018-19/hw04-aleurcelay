## Tidy data and joins

This is an R Markdown document that has the objective of practicing and strengthen data wrangling skills by working with some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping. 

According to Hadley Wickham, **Data Tidying** is structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

## Loading data and required libraries

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
```

**Data Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation)**



Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
