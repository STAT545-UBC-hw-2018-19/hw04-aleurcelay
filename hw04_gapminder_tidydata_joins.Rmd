## Tidy data and joins

This is an R Markdown document that has the objective of practicing and strengthen data wrangling skills by working with some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping. 

According to Hadley Wickham, **Data Tidying** is structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

## Loading data and required libraries

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
```

**Data Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation)**
 
 Using `gather()` and `spread()` functions to reshape data can be very useful to present tables, figures or doing aggregations and statistical analysis.
 
 ## Activity 2: 
 
- Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

-Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.
-Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

For this activity, I will select the countries from North America: Mexico, United States and Canada. 

First let's only look at the subset of life expectancy in these countries:

```{r}
#subset data from North America
NAmerica = gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Mexico", "United States", "Canada")) %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp)
  
#Put the subset in a table
  kable (NAmerica) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
  
```

Now, let's make the data tidy by using `spread()` which turns a pair of key-values into tidy columns. I will put the outpu in a table and I will also make a plot with this new tidy data. 

```{r, fig.align = 'left', fig.width = 11, fig.height = 5}
NAtable = NAmerica %>%
spread(key = country, value = lifeExp) #define key value pairs for new columns

NAplot = NAmerica %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x="Year", y="Life Expectancy", title= "Life Expectancy in North America") #add axis labels and title

grid.arrange(tableGrob(NAtable), NAplot, nrow = 1) #put table next to plot
```

`spread()` allowed tidying data by making a column for each conytry and each observation in a row. This made it possible to do the above plot easily. We can see that in early years, there was a huge gap between the life expectancy of Mexico and the rest of North America. However, over the years, life expectancy in Mexico increased and in 2007 it was not too far behind from United States and Canada.

Now let's compare life expectancy between US and Canada by making a scatterplot:

```{r}
NAtable %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Canada, y=Mexico)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=year)) +
  geom_smooth(method="lm", color="lightpink")
```
