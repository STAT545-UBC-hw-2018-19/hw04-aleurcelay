## Tidy data and joins

This is an R Markdown document that has the objective of practicing and strengthen data wrangling skills by working with some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping. 

According to Hadley Wickham, **Data Tidying** is structuring datasets to facilitate analysis.

## Loading data and required libraries

```{r, warning=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(gapminder)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(kableExtra)
library(gridExtra)
library(ggplot2)
```

**Data Reshaping Prompts (and relationship to aggregation)**
 
Using `gather()` and `spread()` functions to reshape data can be very useful to present tables, figures or doing aggregations and statistical analysis. 
 
 ## Activity 2: 
 
- Make a tibble with one row per year and columns for life expectancy for two or more countries.

-Use knitr::kable() to make this table look pretty in your rendered homework.
-Take advantage of this new data shape to scatterplot life expectancy for one country against that of another.

For this activity, I will select the countries from North America: Mexico, United States and Canada. 

First let's only look at the subset of life expectancy in these countries:

```{r}
#subset data from North America
NAmerica = gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Mexico", "United States", "Canada")) %>% 
  select(country, year, lifeExp)
  
#Put the subset in a table
  kable (NAmerica) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
  
```

Now, let's make the data tidy by using `spread()` which turns a pair of key-values into tidy columns. I will put the outpu in a table and I will also make a plot with this new tidy data. 

```{r, fig.align = 'left', fig.width = 11, fig.height = 5}
NAtable = NAmerica %>%
spread(key = country, value = lifeExp) #define key value pairs for new columns

NAplot = NAmerica %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, lifeExp, color = country)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x="Year", y="Life Expectancy", title= "Life Expectancy in North America") #add axis labels and title

grid.arrange(tableGrob(NAtable), NAplot, nrow = 1) #put table next to plot
```

`spread()` allowed tidying data by making a column for each country and each observation in a row. This made it possible to do the above plot easily. We can see that in early years, there was a huge gap between the life expectancy of Mexico and the rest of North America. However, over the years, life expectancy in Mexico increased and in 2007 it was not too far behind from United States and Canada.

Now let's compare life expectancy between US and Canada by making a scatterplot:

```{r}
g1 <- NAtable %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Mexico, y=Canada)) +
  geom_point(aes(color= year)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,85,by=2)) + #adjust axis to read plot easier
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,85,by=2)) +
  labs(x= "Life Expectancy in Mexico", y= "Life Expectancy in Canada") #change axis labels
  
g2 <- NAtable %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=Mexico, y=`United States`)) +
  geom_point(aes(color= year)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,85,by=2)) + #adjust axis to read plot easier
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,85,by=2)) +
  labs(x= "Life Expectancy in Mexico", y= "Life Expectancy in US")
  
g3 <- NAtable %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=`United States`, y=Canada)) +
  geom_point(aes(color= year)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,85,by=2)) + #adjust axis to read plot easier
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,85,by=2)) +
  labs(x= "Life Expectancy in US", y= "Life Expectancy in Canada")
  
grid.arrange(g1, g2, g3, nrow=2)
```

With the tidy data, we can compare life expectancy between countries in North America. In 1952, life expectancy in Mexico differed more than 15 years compared to Canada and the US, and with time that difference decreased. In 2007, the difference between Mexico and the other two countries was less than 5 years. 


## Activity 3: Compute a measure of life expectancy 

-Compute some measure of life expectancy for all possible combinations of continent and year. Reshape that to have one row per year and one variable for each continent. Or the other way around: one row per continent and one variable per year.

-Use knitr::kable() to make these tables look pretty in your rendered homework.

-Is there a plot that is easier to make with the data in this shape versis the usual form? If so (or you think so), try it! Reflect.


For this task, I will look at the maximum values of life expectancy in continents throughout the year.
First, let's look at the subset of this value without tidying yet:

```{r}
Max_LE=gapminder %>%
  group_by(year, continent) %>%
  summarize(max_lifeExp=max(lifeExp)) # Calculate the maximum value of life expectancy
  
kable(Max_LE) %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

Now, let's reshape the subset above turning each continent into a variable and having one row per year:

```{r}
tidy_continent=Max_LE %>%
spread(key = continent, value= max_lifeExp)

kable(tidy_continent) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

With this arrangement, we can compare for example the maximum values of life expectancy between two continents for the 12 years of data as follows:

```{r}
tidy_continent %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(Africa, Europe, color = factor(year)))+
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,90,by=2)) + #adjust axis scale and breaks
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,80,by=2)) +
  labs(x= "Maximum Life Expectancy in Africa", y="Maximum Life Expectancy in Europe")
```

In the plot above, we can see how Europe's maximum value of life expectancy has ranged from 72 to 82, whilst Africa's has a wider range: between 52 and 77.


I can also arrange the data the other way around, making one row per continent and one variable per year. 

```{r}
tidy_year=Max_LE%>%
  spread(key=year, value=max_lifeExp)

tidy_year%>%  
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

This allows to compare two years of data, for example:

```{r}
tidy_year %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_point(aes(`2007`, `1997`, color = continent)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0,90,by=0.5)) + #adjust axis scale and breaks
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,90,by=0.5)) +
  labs(x= "Maximum Life Expectancy in 2007", y="Maximum Life Expectancy in 1997")
```

The plot shows how the maximum value of life expectancy changed in 10 years for the 5 continents. In general, they all increased over this period of time. 


`gather()` does the opposite of `spread()`. It collects a set of column names and places them into a single "key" column.

Let's check it out to rearrange the data again: 

```{r}
gather(tidy_year, year, max_lifeExp, -continent) %>% #define data, key and value, less the continent column created.
  select(year, continent, max_lifeExp) %>% #rearrenge order of columns
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
```

Now we have the original subset. In this case, R put all the year columns that I had before into a single one. 


**Join Prompts (join, merge, look up)**

## Activity #1

Create a second data frame, complementary to Gapminder. Join this with (part of) Gapminder using a dplyr join function and make some observations about the process and result. Explore the different types of joins. 

For this task, I will choose some European countries I've visited. The variables in this second data frame will be:

*country
*language spoken
*a city visited
*NATO membership 
*OECD membership

Now, let's create the data frame:

```{r}
country <- c ("Austria", "Croatia", "Czech Republic", "France", "Hungary","Slovak Republic","Slovenia", "Switzerland")
language <-c ("German", "Croatian", "Czech", "French", "Hungarian", "Slovak", "Slovene", "French")
city <- c("Vienna", "Zagreb", "Prague", "Paris", "Budapest", "Bratislava", "Ljubljana", "Geneva")
NATO <- c(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0) # 1: member of NATO, 0: non member
OECD <- c(1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1) # 1: member of OECD, 0: non member

new_df <- data.frame(country, language, city, NATO, OECD)

kable(new_df) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center")
  
```
